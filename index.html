My Mirror to the World<b> Simple and Clean</b><br>
<h2>Hidden Motto: Simple Living High Thinking</h2>
<b>I hail from New Delhi<br> and currently</b>I am a dual degree student in <a href="iiit.ac.in">IIIT-Hyderabad</a>, studying Computer Science and 
MS in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science">Computational Sciences</a>. <b>Too much for loving Mathematics :D</b><br><br>

I am into programming as well, I &lt3 Javascript not because its easy to work with, but because of the scope of things possible. Other than that, I love to automate my daily jobs(repetative work bores me) and therefore I am pretty quick with Bash and Python. More details about my skills are in my <a href = "http://1drv.ms/1CapQ7j">Curriculam Vitae</a>. <b>I believe that I am pretty good, fast at programming and very punctual too.</b><br>

I am a research student and currently working with <a href="http://www.iiit.ac.in/~deva/Deva/Deva.html">Prof. Deva</a> @ CCNSB learning about. My current research work is around Quantum Computational Chemistry.<b> I eventually want to do something in Machine Learning. I have plans, but won't share ideas.</b><br>
I consider myself an intellectual bloke, (some people are reminded of Human Values classes when I start speaking :p).<br>
Otherwise I love to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40907614-sagar-gaur">books</a> 
and to my own surprise I am good at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/pmo16ho3i93z13u/AAD3Hp_ZxsPNZ4lzWCxW_rbxa">arts and digital design</a>. Sometimes I write, but I generally don't make it public.<b> unless there is a good reason to do so.</b> <br>
<br>
This page may be boring, but I am an interesting person, so get in touch, drop an <a href="mailto:gaursagar21@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://facebook.com/firzens">facebook</a> me.<br><br>
<b>Why do more people don't use github page as their hompage; this shit is easy to maintain</b>
